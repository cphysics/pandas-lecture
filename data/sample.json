The city plans to install as many as 200 of them\u2014which means the investment will amount to Rs 120,000,000.

At the risk of adding yet another example to its (now growing) list of hollow and foundationless promises, the officials concerned must demonstrate their claimed commitment through tangible results.As Nepal\u2019s third mutual evaluation report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering watchdog, is nearing its 2020 deadline, time is of the essence\u2014especially as the country faces potential blacklisting. In 2010, when FATF included Nepal in its list of \u2018nations that failed to comply with the action plan related to anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorists\u2019, the government leapt into action, making tangible strides in improving anti-money laundering strategies."]}]
